##Unsolved problems:

On some images when adding a comment, the comment doesn't show up until you either refresh the page or upload another comment.

##Planning:

For planning, we spent time in the beginning clearly laying out MVP versus stretch goals. We layed out group roles. Shawn was the scrum master. Joel was in charge of the front-end and Xia was in charge of the back-end. But we made sure everyone was included in every step. We had a Trello board as well as a Google Doc to keep track of all of our features and goals. We spent a LOT of time pair programming. We had retrospectives everyday where we caught each other up on features we worked on and highlighted problems. We merged and pulled on our separate computers in a coordinated way to ensure we all had the current versions. When one of us had a problem, we would all come together to work on one computer and try and solve it. We could have been better at naming partners in our commits, and making sure everyone made a commit in each repo.
